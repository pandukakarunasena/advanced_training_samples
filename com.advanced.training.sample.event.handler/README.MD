USE CASE : <br />
Event handler just prints the event properties in the console (Username & tenant-domain). 
But you can customize the event handler to do whatever you want (Ex: Send an email after adding a user).

CONFIGURATION : <br />
[[event_handler]] <br />
name="customUserRegistration" <br />
subscriptions=["PRE_ADD_USER","POST_ADD_USER"] <br />

The following guide shows you how to write a custom event handler. <br />
